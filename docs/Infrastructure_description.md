### Frontend app infrastructure

For the frontend we needed S3 buckets to host the frontend app.

### Backend app infrastructure.

For the backend app we needed the following services

- [RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rds/?icmpid=docs_homepage_featuredsvcs) to host the app postgres database.
- [Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elastic-beanstalk/?icmpid=docs_homepage_compute) along with [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/?icmpid=docs_homepage_compute) to host the backend api app.
